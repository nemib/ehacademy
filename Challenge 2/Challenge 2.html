        Nobody’s born smart. We all <em>start</em> at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at <em>anything</em> at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t <strong>count</strong> to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just  <em>like</em> the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are <strong> to learn</strong>.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until <em>one</em> day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. <strong>learning</strong>.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <strong>yet</strong>.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere <em>can</em> understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know <em>one</em> thing:<br>
        You can learn <strong>anything</strong>.
