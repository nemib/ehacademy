        <p>The <em>Peacock</em> is awesome because <strong>it has a distinctive coloration</strong>  Peacock are forest birds that nest on the ground, but roost in trees. They are terrestrial feeders. All species of peafowl are believed to be polygamous.
            Peacocks are some of the most widely recognized birds in the world, due to their beautiful blue-green plumage and spotted tail feathers, which fold open into an elaborate fan. These birds are about more than their feathers, though, and not many people know much about the birds and how they live or interact..</p>
         <p>Peacocks, or peafowl, as the word "peacock" only refers to the male of the species, are commonly seen in zoos, on ranches and on hobby farms in the United States and in Europe. However, peacocks are originally native to the forests of Asia. These birds are members of the pheasant family, and they exhibit many of the same behaviors as other pheasants. They are ground feeders, meaning that they spend most of the time searching for food on the ground. They tend to live in forested areas and will hide in tall grass or shrubbery to escape predators.

            In spite of their large size, peacocks are capable of flight. In fact, they are one of the largest and heaviest flying birds in the world. If a peacock is startled, it may fly to escape danger, though it cannot stay in the air for extended periods of time due to its weight. </p>
