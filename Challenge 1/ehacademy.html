        <h1> "The street" </h1>
        <p1>Itâ€™s a long and silent street.<br>
            I walk in the dark and trip and fall<br>
            and get up and step blindly<br>
            on the mute stones and dry leaves<br>
            and someone behind me is also walking:<br>
            if I stop, he stops;<br>
            if I run, he runs. I turn around: no one.<br>
            Everything is black, there is no exit,<br>
            and I turn and turn corners<br>
            that always lead to the street<br>
            where no one waits for me, no one follows,<br>
            where I follow a man who trips<br>
            and gets up and says when he sees me: no one.</p1>
